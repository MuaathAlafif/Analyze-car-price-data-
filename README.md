Introduction:

Analyzing car prices and their relationship with mileage is essential for understanding market behavior. In this project, we explore data related to car prices from different brands and their mileage to derive valuable insights.

Objective:

The main objectives of this project are:

To analyze the distribution of car prices across various brands.
To study the relationship between car prices and the mileage of the cars.
To extract the average price for each car brand.
Description
In this project, a synthetic dataset is created, containing information about car prices, mileage, and car brands. We use this data to explore statistical relationships and insights using various Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Libraries Used:

Numpy: To generate random data representing car prices and mileage.
Pandas: To create and analyze data in a tabular format (DataFrame).
Matplotlib: To visualize the data through various plots.

Methodology:

Data Creation: Synthetic data is generated using the Numpy library, which includes car prices, mileage, and car brand information.
Data Analysis: The Pandas library is used to analyze the data and compute the average price for each car brand.
Data Visualization: The Matplotlib library is employed to create plots that showcase the distribution of car prices and the relationship between mileage and price.


Code Outputs:

1-First 5 Rows of the Data.

2-Average Price Per Brand.

3-Data Visualization:

-Distribution of Car Prices.

-Car Prices vs. Mileage.


These visualizations help in understanding how car prices are distributed across the dataset and how mileage correlates with the car prices.
